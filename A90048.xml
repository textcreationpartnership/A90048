            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis I ≈øuppo≈øe will be the la≈øt which I ≈øhall give you of intelligence, in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Northern affaires; and ble≈ø≈øed bee God, that hath brought things there to ≈øo good an i≈ø≈øue: Our mourning is now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:159968:3"/>
to mu≈øick, the voyce of the Turtle is now heard in our Land. God grant we may ≈øee the things that belongs to our peace in ths our day.</p>
            <p>Thur≈øday the 11. in≈øtant, the Rear of the Scotch Army marched over Tweed at Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øey and Barwick, and the next day the town of Barwick was quitted, and the Gari≈øon di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled, according to agreement: the ≈øixe Regiments of their hor≈øe, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to disband, had their Rendezvouz at Kel≈øey, where they were required. 1. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their Armes. 2. To take an oath to this effect: <hi>To offer no injury to the Country in their pa≈ø≈øage to their ≈øeverall Homes; to bee faithfull to the Covenant and cau≈øe of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and not to ingage with any again≈øt them: At fir≈øt, they refu≈øed; but at la≈øt were induced to accept of them; partly by the meanes of their Lieut. Gen. David Le≈øly, and partly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of their Mini≈øters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both of the≈øe were nece≈ø≈øary, if we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the con≈øtitution of ≈øome of tho≈øe who were disbanded, who re≈øolved to joyne with Kilketto, being much incen≈øed at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:159968:3"/>Vpon the taking the Oath, and delivering up their pi≈øtols, they had pay upon the place, ≈øome one, ≈øome two, ≈øome 3 moneths pay, according to the yeares of their ≈øervice. This done, the Lieut. Gen. very nobly &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of them, if they had any thing to ≈øay of him, or any other of their Officers; they an≈øwered no: thereupon they broke the Standards of every Regiment, and ≈øo were all di≈øpierced towards their ≈øeverall homes; except tho≈øe who were ≈øelected for a New Model, who cho≈øe the be≈øt pi≈øtols (of tho≈øe delivered up) for them≈øelves. Mo≈øt of the≈øe are of the Arguile party, officers and ≈øouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet ≈øome of them unwilling to continue in arms.</p>
            <p>The new Model is fourteen hundred Hor≈øe, and five thou≈øand Foot. The Hamiltonians are much di≈øcontented at this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> might acquaint you with the ≈øpoyl and plunder they made in Northumberland, and their not paying of quarters from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the fir≈øt 100000. l. till this time; but I had rather the≈øe and the like complements were buried: there will be di≈øorders in the be≈øt governed Bodies, Courts, Camps, City, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:159968:4"/>
Country, none are exempted: the be≈øt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument is ≈øomtimes out of tune: Love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of ≈øins: its the want of that which fir≈øt occa≈øions the offence; and then in others rai≈øes ≈ølanders, whence ari≈øe all the clamors and ≈øcandals again≈øt this Army, but only from want of affections: ≈øure the army hath de≈øerved better from them, and might have had better words a yeare ≈øince, when an Enemy was in the field. <hi>But now the work is done, how are they ≈ølighted: the generall cry is now for a disbanding; and for my part (&amp;</hi> I <hi>thinke divers others of quality in the Army would be of my mind) it ≈øhould be the fir≈øt thing I would petition for, ≈øeeing now it is only ≈øet up as a marke for every tongue ≈øet on fire to dart forth their malice again≈øt, and every Malignant Prie≈øt, and upstart Levite, to rai≈øe and write ≈ølanders, to fill Gangrenaes Volumes. Sir, I have no more at pre≈øent, only I remain,</hi>

            <p>SInce the coming of the Kings Maie≈øty to Holmby, there hath been a great di≈øpute between his Maie≈øty, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh Divines, ≈øtrong Arguments were held by the King, in defence of the Liturgie and Epi≈øcopal Government; but many gallant Rea≈øons were propounded to his Maie≈øty, (for convincing of his con≈øcience, and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Judgment (by that Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Mr. Stephen Mar≈øhal; giving many learned and ≈øtrong Rea≈øons in defence of the Government, now e≈øtabli≈øhed within the Kingdome of England, by the Authority of both hou≈øes of Parliament: But (as yet) the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe lyes in di≈øpence, and his Maie≈øty hath further declared, that hee cannot give his Royall a≈ø≈øent, for the confirming and enacting of the Presbyteriall Government; until ≈øuch time, as he hath conferred with ≈øome of his own Chaplains, about the ≈øame, his Con≈øcience being tender (in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect) for the pre≈øervation of the Prote≈øtant
