            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH SPOKEN By his Excellency Generall <hi>LEVEN,</hi> to all his Officers and Souldiers, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of his Army</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis I ſuppoſe will be the laſt which I ſhall give you of intelligence, in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Northern affaires; and bleſſed bee God, that hath brought things there to ſo good an iſſue: Our mourning is now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:159968:3"/>
to muſick, the voyce of the Turtle is now heard in our Land. God grant we may ſee the things that belongs to our peace in ths our day.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 11. inſtant, the Rear of the Scotch Army marched over Tweed at Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey and Barwick, and the next day the town of Barwick was quitted, and the Gariſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled, according to agreement: the ſixe Regiments of their horſe, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to disband, had their Rendezvouz at Kelſey, where they were required. 1. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their Armes. 2. To take an oath to this effect: <hi>To offer no injury to the Country in their paſſage to their ſeverall Homes; to bee faithfull to the Covenant and cauſe of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and not to ingage with any againſt them: At firſt, they refuſed; but at laſt were induced to accept of them; partly by the meanes of their Lieut. Gen. David Leſly, and partly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of their Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both of theſe were neceſſary, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſtitution of ſome of thoſe who were disbanded, who reſolved to joyne with Kilketto, being much incenſed at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:159968:3"/>Vpon the taking the Oath, and delivering up their piſtols, they had pay upon the place, ſome one, ſome two, ſome 3 moneths pay, according to the yeares of their ſervice. This done, the Lieut. Gen. very nobly &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of them, if they had any thing to ſay of him, or any other of their Officers; they anſwered no: thereupon they broke the Standards of every Regiment, and ſo were all diſpierced towards their ſeverall homes; except thoſe who were ſelected for a New Model, who choſe the beſt piſtols (of thoſe delivered up) for themſelves. Moſt of theſe are of the Arguile party, officers and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet ſome of them unwilling to continue in arms.</p>
            <p>The new Model is fourteen hundred Horſe, and five thouſand Foot. The Hamiltonians are much diſcontented at this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> might acquaint you with the ſpoyl and plunder they made in Northumberland, and their not paying of quarters from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the firſt 100000. l. till this time; but I had rather theſe and the like complements were buried: there will be diſorders in the beſt governed Bodies, Courts, Camps, City, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:159968:4"/>
Country, none are exempted: the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is ſomtimes out of tune: Love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of ſins: its the want of that which firſt occaſions the offence; and then in others raiſes ſlanders, whence ariſe all the clamors and ſcandals againſt this Army, but only from want of affections: ſure the army hath deſerved better from them, and might have had better words a yeare ſince, when an Enemy was in the field. <hi>But now the work is done, how are they ſlighted: the generall cry is now for a disbanding; and for my part (&amp;</hi> I <hi>thinke divers others of quality in the Army would be of my mind) it ſhould be the firſt thing I would petition for, ſeeing now it is only ſet up as a marke for every tongue ſet on fire to dart forth their malice againſt, and every Malignant Prieſt, and upstart Levite, to raiſe and write ſlanders, to fill Gangrenaes Volumes. Sir, I have no more at preſent, only I remain,</hi>

            <p>SInce the coming of the Kings Maieſty to Holmby, there hath been a great diſpute between his Maieſty, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Divines, ſtrong Arguments were held by the King, in defence of the Liturgie and Epiſcopal Government; but many gallant Reaſons were propounded to his Maieſty, (for convincing of his conſcience, and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Judgment (by that Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Mr. Stephen Marſhal; giving many learned and ſtrong Reaſons in defence of the Government, now eſtabliſhed within the Kingdome of England, by the Authority of both houſes of Parliament: But (as yet) the buſineſſe lyes in diſpence, and his Maieſty hath further declared, that hee cannot give his Royall aſſent, for the confirming and enacting of the Presbyteriall Government; until ſuch time, as he hath conferred with ſome of his own Chaplains, about the ſame, his Conſcience being tender (in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) for the preſervation of the Proteſtant

            <p>The King continues (ſtill) very pleaſant, being very chearful, merry, and familiar, only he deſires to come to, or neare the City of London.
